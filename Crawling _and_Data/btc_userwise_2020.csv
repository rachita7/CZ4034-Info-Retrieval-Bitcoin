Bitcoin closing in my original target near $19,150 and I'm far too smart to short there 

Meme uptrend forming and could see a short term pullback after a tap of the $19,150 to $19,200 area

This is honestly the type of price action you want to see - slow, stair-step up to new highs

I really thought Bitcoin would pullback by $19k but max pain for people, not yet in BTC, may be to push straight over $20k in the coming days/weeks
