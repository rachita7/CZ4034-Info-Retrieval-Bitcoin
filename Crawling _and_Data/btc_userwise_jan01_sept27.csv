A #BTC Monthly Close above ~$45200 would be phenomenal

So how could the Pi Cycle Top 111-DMA support #BTC's price stability above ~$42000?

It simply needs to continue figuring as support

#BTC needs to maintain itself above the 21-week EMA, ideally even reclaim the red area as support until the end of September

How does this all play into the Monthly Close for #BTC?

Firstly, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that $BTC has been forming consistent Higher Lows for 4-months straight

Secondly, BTC has broken the blue resistance of ~$45K this past August (by comparison BTC couldn‚Äôt do this in Feb) https://t.co/eO86oPEcpn",rektcapital,1,1,22,0,['BTC']

But red is at ~$43700 which is a higher price than ~$42000 above which #BTC needs to register a Monthly Close

Simply consolidating between the Pi Cycle Top MA and red for the next few weeks would be sufficient for $BTC to perform a Monthly Close above ~$42K later this month https://t.co/VYy6zvSX6A",rektcapital,1,1,18,0,['BTC']

What could support #BTC's price stability above ~$42000 is the orange Pi Cycle Top 111-day Moving Average

Because $BTC is currently in the process of a mid-term retest of the orange Pi Cycle Top 111-day MA

This retest has been successful thus far...
