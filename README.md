Twitter News Retrieval System on the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency for 2021

This project contains 3 main sections
1. Crawling

    We utilized snscrape to crawl Twitter and collected tweets regarding the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency from various countries.
    The Crawled data had the following columns:
    | Field Name | Description |
    | ---------- | ----------- |
    | username   | Contains the username of the user that posted the tweet|
    | content    | Contains the actual tweet|
    | date       | Contains the date on which the tweet was posted|
    | country    | Contains the country where the user lives in|
    | replycount | Contains the number of people that commented on the tweet|
    | retweetcount| Contains the number of people that shared that particular tweet|
    | likecount  | Contains the number of people that liked that particular tweet|
    | followersCount| Contains the number of followers the twitter user has|
    | verified | Contains a boolean status indicating whether the user is verfied or not|

2. Indexing and Querying
    
    Indexing is a way to optimize the performance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed.  We created an inverted index using Solr to optimize the search
    process. Inverted index helps optimizing the search process and allows fast full text search, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added.

    We also incorporated the spell check feature into our system which was implemented with the help of the n-grams algorithm.

3. Sentiment Analysis

    Final Model Performance:
    | Model    | F1 Score | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
    | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
    | RoBERTa  | 0.78     | 0.78     | 0.78      | 0.78  |
    
Enhancements applied: After PCA analysis, we could notice the places where our model was lacking due to which we implemented Data Augmentation and model Fine-Tuning to increase accuracy. 

## Quickstart

To start solr:

```bash
cd solr
./bin/solr start
```

To start the flask app:

```bash
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
